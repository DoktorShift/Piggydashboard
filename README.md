# Piggy Dashboard

Piggy Dashboard is a custom solution I created for my nephews, inspired by the amazing work of the [LNbits](https://lnbits.com) and [LightningPiggy](https://www.lightningpiggy.com/) projects.

## Overview

This project is a fork of the original [Naughtify project](https://github.com/DoktorShift/naughtify), which is very well documented and provides a great step by step instruction for creating this.
